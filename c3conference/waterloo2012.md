C3 was created to unlock the huge potential of student leaders at University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University by *Connecting* them with other high-energy, high-achieving students to *Collaborate* on an entrepreneurial venture or social change initiative and obtain the resources they need to *Create* something that will make a positive, lasting impact on the world.

The C3 conference accomplishes this objective through structured networking events, inspiring speakers, and guided breakout sessions. Selected applicants will have the opportunity to form teams with delegates that have complementary skills and similar visions through the networking sessions. They will then develop their teams by working together in the break-out sessions and applying the messages delivered by the speakers. Each team will deliver a brief presentation explaining their idea and a high-level project plan.

There are two streams within the conference. The first is for-profit entrepreneurial ventures and the second is not-for-profit social change initiatives. Students rank their preference for which stream they would like to be a part of in their application. Each stream has distinct breakout sessions.

This year's conference was held on **November 10** at **RCH (J.R. Coutts Engineering Lecture Hall)** at the University of Waterloo.
