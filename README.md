## [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)

The C3 Inspire website is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), documentation is available [here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

Jekyll allows you to create HTML pages and blog posts from plain text.
It supports "templates" and "includes" to make reusing common layouts and elements much easier.
Take a look at the files in this repository for examples of how this works.

## [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

Blog posts are written using a syntax called [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), the basics of which are explained [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics).

It provides an easy way to format plain text with headers, emphasis, lists, links, and images.
A Markdown tutorial is available [here](http://www.markdowntutorial.com) and you may experiment with the syntax [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus).
