Entrepreneurship classes can often be found in secondary and post-secondary institutions, and have become standard in general business education. But are these classes a simple waste of time? Some of the world’s most renown entrepreneurs never took “entrepreneurship classes”, and some never finished school! Noam Wasserman and Victor W. Hwang take on the yes and no for this very split question. Below is an excerpt from their article:

<blockquote>
	<p>Yes: Learn About the Pitfalls</p>
	<p>Eighty years ago, Ralph Heilman, the dean of Northwestern University’s School of Commerce, wrote an article entitled, “Can Business Be Taught?” His answer: yes. Take the lessons about what works and what doesn’t, analyze and organize them, and then teach them—just as we do with engineers, doctors and lawyers.</p>
	<p>Clearly, the process works for training M.B.A.s. So, why not entrepreneurs? After all, entrepreneurs are the ultimate general managers. They can benefit from much of the same knowledge that business students gain about marketing, finance and other topics, complemented by lessons that are specifically tailored to start-ups.</p>
	<p>And those lessons are getting better all the time.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<p>No: The Best Class Is Real Life</p>
	<p>Entrepreneurship can’t be taught in a regular classroom any more than surfboarding can. To learn it, you have to get your feet wet in the real world.</p>
	<p>Why? Entrepreneurship is messy. For an entrepreneur, there are rarely clear-cut right or wrong decisions day to day. Real life gives entrepreneurs the ability to better make those kinds of judgment calls.</p>
	<p>Entrepreneurship is also a team sport, not a solo skill. We all know the myth of the “lone wolf” entrepreneur, tucked away in a basement or garage tinkering with an invention. In reality, an entrepreneur has to deal with lots of different people daily, all of whom present social barriers to overcome, whether it’s geography, culture, language or just plain distrust.</p>
