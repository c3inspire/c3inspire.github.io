HEY! C3 Inspire has a fun little contest for you!

We’ve put up some C3 Meme Posters around the UW and WLU campus for you to find. When you find our poster:

1. Take a picture with the meme

2. Post it to Facebook that day

3. Tag “C3 Conference” so we find it  and you can to win some sweet prizes!

Keep a lookout for the posters starting today and the person with the most “likes” on Facebook by 7pm the next day wins a glorious prize! Yes, we have lots of prizes!

But wait – there more!

New memes will be put up daily from Monday to Thursday both this week and next week!

Remember also to apply for the C3 Conference before Sep 26th and Unlock Your Potential (in addition to your awesome picture taking, contest winning, Facebook using skills)

Happy contesting everyone!!
