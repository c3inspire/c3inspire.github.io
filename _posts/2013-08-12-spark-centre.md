Earlier this summer, the C3 Inspire team had a chance to participate in the “Ignite Finale” which featured many VIP guests including Bruce Croxon from the TV show Dragon’s Den.  Ignite is an exciting entrepreneurial journey organized by Spark Centre and The Region of Durham, along with many local community partners. It begins with a pitch school open to all applicants and ends with an extraordinary finale celebrating two local start-ups.

C3 Inspire was pleased to participate and support Spark Centre in their efforts to promote entrepreneurship and student innovation in the GTA.  Both C3 Inspire and Spark Centre share many common values.  As we gear up for the upcoming GTA C3 Conference in January 2014, we wanted to share with you what Spark Centre does so you can take advantage of the many resources they have available!

Spark Centre helps start and grow innovative technology-based companies in Durham Region and Northumberland County. We help start-up companies find the best path to market, and we surround them with the tools, people and connections they need to get there faster. We also help existing companies develop relationships and create strategies that can drive faster growth.

Spark Centre is the place where entrepreneurs, innovators, investors, researchers and students come together to exchange ideas, help each other succeed, and form an innovation ecosystem that creates jobs and wealth in our regions. Created by the Durham Strategic Energy Alliance, Spark Centre is one of fourteen not-for-profit Regional Innovation Centres (RICs) that form part of the Ontario Network of Entrepreneurs (ONE).

Spark Centre offers coaching and mentorship, learning tools, connections to business and research networks, and help with access to investment. Our services are provided thanks to the generous financial support of the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development and Innovation, Durham Region, the Durham Strategic Energy Alliance (DSEA) and the Northumberland Manufacturer’s Association (NMA).
