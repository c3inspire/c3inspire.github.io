The fast pace of technology has greatly changed our lives and challenged our imagination. Thalmic Labs is a Waterloo-based start-up that is dedicated to the development of wearable technology with focus on human-computer interaction. They launched their flagship product, MYO in February and collected over $3.7 million dollar in pre-orders in just a month. We are honored to have the chance to speak with Marketing Director of Thalmic Labs, Sameera Banduk, to get an insider perspective of the revolutionary start-up.

### What was your objective when you decided to start a business?
To change the world, to push technology forward. We all love solving challenging problems, and the business is an avenue to solve the problems we’re interested in, and then distribute the solutions beyond us to people everywhere. We want to give people superpowers using technology.

### How did Thalmic Labs founders turn an idea into a business?
The three founders first build a proof-of-concept prototype to prove out that the idea was technologically feasible. It was then many months of iterations on the first prototype and research into the market potential before we were ready to show it to investors and begin to speed up development. After raising some initial funding, focus shifted to recruiting talent who could accelerate the research and development process. Finally, slightly under a year into development, we were ready to announce the product to the public earlier this year.

### So what is MYO?
MYO connects the real and the digital world. It provides a way for us to interact with and control computers and other digital devices directly using our hands. Fundamentally, Thalmic is attempting to close the gap between humans and technology.

### Were people in your team all strangers before start-up? If you start a business with your friend, what kind of things you need to look out for?

One really key thing when you’re starting a company is that working with people you get along with – people you like, and smart people – is such an important thing. Our founders Stephen, Matthew and Aaron were all classmates in the University of Waterloo’s mechatronics engineering program and our Director of Developer Relations, Scott Greenberg, was also a part of the same mechatronics graduating class. The four were close friends for years before starting Thalmic: they had worked and lived together in multiple countries, and even competed together in the world championships of Dragon Boat (a water sport). The team, which brings together expertise across many different engineering and non-technical disciplines, has grown organically from there. Employees have joined Thalmic in Waterloo from as far away as Australia and from all across North America. Each new hire goes through an intensive 6-step interview process including interviews and tests assessing general intelligence and domain-specific technical skills, along with an evaluation of soft-skills and fit with the company culture. We look for people who are both smart and relentlessly resourceful. If those two are there, the rest will fall into place.

### What kind of backgrounds/experiences is crucial to a start-up team?
For a founding team, a wide diversity of experience generally, while having domain expertise in the area of your start-up is important. Early on, the team needs a competitive advantage. Perhaps this is deep domain knowledge or technical expertise (as in our case), or perhaps it’s operational excellence, experience or connections. If you’re building a product for airline pilots, founders that have worked in the aviation industry and are deeply passionate about the area are ideal. I believe many of the soft skills and the business skills can be learned along the way.

### How did you obtain the initial funding? How much was it? Where did it go?
In our first 8 months of working on MYO, we were spending a large amount of money from our student lines of credit and credit cards. The support that we received from our parents really helped us get this idea off the ground as well. We were also awarded $25,000 through the University of Waterloo’s Velocity Venture Fund in October 2012, and later received funding as part of the Y Combinator winter 2013 class. In January 2013, we announced that we had received $1.1 million in seed funding. This money was invested by angel investors including ATI Technologies co-founder Lee Lau, HP Canada CEO Paul Tsaparis, Dayforce co-founder David Ossip, and Rypple co-founder Dan Debow. All of this funding has allowed us to get the equipment and hire the talent needed to bring this product to market as quickly as possible.

### What was the early advertising strategy you adopted to promote your product/service?
The marketing around the launch of MYO was designed inspire our audience to think of the possibilities unleashed by the device. While we showed only a few specific applications in a demo video that was widely circulated, it left viewers with their creative juices flowing. The video was very well received. It quickly spread through the internet and received over 2M views in the first 30 days. The press was also a key promoter early on. We had reached out to a couple reporters we thought would be interested in covering the launch, and they published great pieces early on. After that, more of the tech media joined in and helped spread the word about MYO.
