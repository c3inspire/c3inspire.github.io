Finding a job that is perfectly tailored for you is extremely difficult. But don’t worry, Deskribed can help. Deskribed is a highly personalized tool to help you get your perfect job, without the hassle of having to look for it.

We were honored to invite Karim Gillani, the co-founder of this amazing company to talk to us about his start-up experience.

### Before we get started, can you tell me a little bit about yourself?
I started my career as a developer in the financial services industry and moved on to product management, consulting and business development. I spent some time in the UK working for Redknee, designing network infrastructure for mobile carriers. I then moved to BlackBerry, where I helped build the business development team, and led the M&A efforts in Silicon Valley. I studied Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo and have a Masters in Finance and Economic Policy from the University of London.

### What was your objective when you decided to start a business?
We were trying to solve a major problem: bringing employers and job-seekers together in an efficient way. Before we started, different people would contact me every few weeks, either looking for a job, or looking to hire for a job. The question was either “do you know anyone who’s hiring?” or “do you know anyone who’s looking?” I tried my best to connect people together on an ad-hoc basis, but it just seemed very inefficient. So we decided to build a platform that intelligently brought job seekers and employers together in a way that makes the experience highly personalized for both sides.

### What was the process of turning your idea into a business? What did you do first?
It started with a bunch of whiteboard marker notes all over the windows of my San Francisco apartment. I thought about what the user experience might be, what the business model might look like and did a bunch of research about the market. I bounced the idea off some friends and anyone else who might have an opinion. After getting great feedback, I teamed up with my co-founder, Shayan, and we started developing a functional spec. We brought in a design team to help with the UX and started on mock-ups. A couple months later, we were writing code and working on our first release.

### What is the problem that Deskribed is aiming to solve?
The larger problem is that a big portion of the working population wakes up to a job that doesn’t fully make them happy. They’ve been in their role for too long, they’re not learning anything new, they’re not making enough money or they are generally unfulfilled in some way. When you’re in that situation, it’s hard to find something new that you would enjoy, even if you really want to. You get stuck in a bit of a pattern. Deskribed makes it easy to see what other opportunities are available for you. In the long term, we can even help you build a personalized career path and deliver the jobs that allow you to progress.

### If you start a business with a friend, what kind of things do you need to look out for?
Shayan and I knew each other before we started Deskribed. We worked together in the past and knew each other’s style. We complement each other really well, and he’s one of the only people I would trust with my life. For me that was the biggest criteria: you have to trust your partner 100%. And beyond that, you need to make sure you have the same general philosophy and ethics. Even our design partners at Big Time Design fall into the same boat. They’re an amazing team and they understand our way of thinking.

### What kind of backgrounds/experiences to you think is crucial to a start-up team?
It depends on the nature of your startup. Your core team needs to be passionate and driven. In terms of backgrounds, if you’re a tech startup, then at least one (if not all) of your founders must have a technical background. It’s very difficult to start a tech company without fully understanding the nuts and bolts of the technology. You then need to have some business acumen to build a model that will generate revenue for the company. Having some sense of business law helps as well, especially when you have to deal with various types of contracts.

### How did you obtain the initial funding? How much was it? Where did it go?
As of right now, we’ve entirely bootstrapped the project. We’re not really looking for funding at this point.

### What was the advertising strategy you adopted early on to promote your product/service?
To be honest, our marketing strategy has been pretty crude so far. We’ve pushed on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. But beyond that, word of mouth has been a big driver for us. We have also partnered with some of the top tech companies in Toronto to help us attract new job seeker users. We’re working with Xtreme Labs, BNOTIONS, Polar Mobile, Top Hat, BigKite Consulting and others.
