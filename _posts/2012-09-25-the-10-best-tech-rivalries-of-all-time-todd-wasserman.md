Today’s rapid growth in technology is driving demand for the latest and greatest gadgets! For companies, it’s all about who’s first to market and which designs and features are better. In this competitive market space, it’s no surprise that a full thermonuclear war has begun. [Todd Wasserman](http://mashable.com/author/todd-wasserman/) counts down the 10 best moments of all time. Below is an excerpt from his article:

<blockquote>
	<p>Bill Gates has pledged to give away $60 billion, making him probably the most generous philanthropist in history. Yet Steve Jobs was unimpressed. For him, such largesse was merely proof of Gates’ utter dorkiness.</p>
	<p>“Bill is basically unimaginative and has never invented anything, which is why I think he’s more comfortable now in philanthropy than technology. He just shamelessly ripped off other people’s ideas,” Jobs told biographer Walter Isaacson in Steve Jobs.</p>
	<p>For his part, Gates was not afraid to kick Jobs when Apple was down, in 1998. “What I can’t figure out is why [Jobs] is even trying [to be the CEO of Apple]?” Gates said at the time. “He knows he can’t win.” Cue evil laughter.</p>
	<p>Yet as rivalries go, Jobs-Gates was more impressive for its duration than its vitriol. In the height of the Microsoft-Apple rivalry, it’s hard to imagine either going after each other the way Samsung and Apple are now. The epic fight between the two stretches the courtrooms across the globe. Apple fanboys have infiltrated Samsung’s Facebook page. In turn, Samsung lampoons the fanboys in its go-for-the-jugular ads.</p>
	<p>For whatever reason, most of the biggest feuds in tech have involved Apple. As this list shows, the Cupertino giant gives as good as it gets.</p>
