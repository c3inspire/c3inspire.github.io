Toronto Workforce Innovation Group, which is Toronto’s Workforce Planning Board, works with both social innovation groups and social enterprises to draw attention to the broad range of workforce development activity in Toronto’s labour market. We identify both social and economic issues and drive change by helping Torontonians understand their complex and multi-layered economy. We work with all types of business and social groups to connect people to good jobs in Toronto’s vibrant economy. Some of the social enterprises we work with are Hawthorne Food and Drink, Raging Spoon, Working for Change. We are located at 215 Spadina, which is also the home of the Centre for Social Innovation. Our interest and involvement in social change, social innovation and social enterprise fits with our vision of Toronto as a city with sustainable jobs in vibrant economy.

## Definitions of Social Change, social innovation and social enterprise
**Social change** refers to any significant alteration over time in behavior patterns and cultural values and norms. By “significant” alteration, sociologists mean changes yielding *profound* social consequences.

Examples of significant social changes having long‐term effects include the industrial revolution, the abolition of slavery, the feminist movement and the Occupy Movement that highlighted the concentration of wealth in 1% of the population and characterized itself as representing the other 99%.  Mobilizing large groups of people to advocate for a cause or change is central to achieving social change. This is achieved through public education rather than individual acts of charity.

Social change builds community-based responses that address underlying social problems on an individual, institutional, community, national and/or international level. Social change can change attitudes, behaviors, laws, policies and institutions to better reflect values of inclusion, fairness, diversity and opportunity. Social change involves a collective action of individuals who are closest to the social problems to develop solutions that address social issues.

## Social Innovation
Social innovation is an initiative, product, process or program that profoundly changes the basic routines, resource and authority flows or beliefs of any social system. Successful social innovations have durability and broad impact. While social innovation has recognizable stages and phases, achieving durability and scale is a dynamic process that requires both emergence of opportunity and deliberate agency, and a connection between the two. The capacity of any society to create a steady flow of social innovations, particularly those which re-engage vulnerable populations, is an important contributor to the overall social and ecological resilience.

The concept is founded on the following assumptions:

* The need for social innovation is obvious and compelling. The opportunity for social innovation is less obvious, but, equally compelling
* Social problems are, by nature, complex problems - social innovators work in complex systems
* Social innovation requires collaborative enterprise; the social sector, public sector and private sector must work together to create transformative change
* Social innovation requires new forms of knowledge production, combining knowledge from multiple disciplines and from both theory and practice to reframe and solve problems (Waterloo Institute for Social Innovation and Resilience)

Social Innovation is emerging worldwide as people realize that it is time to work together to find new solutions to the challenges facing our society. New initiatives are launched all over the place whether by research institutions, companies or by independent organizations. Those engaged in Social Innovation apply their own definition of Social Innovation, but all definitions have one thing in common: working together towards a sustainable society. Social Innovation has an inter-sectoral approach and is universally applicable. Social Innovation focuses on the process of innovation, how innovation and change take shape and on new work and new forms of cooperation and collaboration.

## Social Enterprise
There is no one definition for social enterprise. Following are some of the most common definitions from the Social Enterprise Canada website, [http://www.socialenterprise.ca](http://www.socialenterprise.ca)

*“Social enterprises are businesses owned by nonprofit organizations that are directly involved in the production and/or selling of goods and services for the blended purpose of generating income and achieving social, cultural, and/or environmental aims. Social enterprises are one more tool for non-profits to use to meet their mission to contribute to healthy communities.”* —Social Enterprise Council of Canada

*“Social enterprises are businesses whose primary purpose is the common good. They use the methods and disciplines of business and the power of the marketplace to advance their social, environmental and human justice agendas.”* —Social Enterprise Alliance, USA

*“A social enterprise is a business …that has a clear sense of its ‘social mission’ and …clear rules about what it does with its profits, reinvesting these to further the ‘social mission.’”* —Social Enterprise, UK

*“A social enterprise is an organization that applies commercial strategies to maximize improvements in human and environmental well-being.  Social enterprises can be a for-profit or non-profit, a co-operative, mutual organization, a social business, or a charity organization.”* —Wikipedia

Social enterprises are businesses that create community impacts and social values and don’t distribute profits and assets to individual shareholders. So rather than a defined thing, social enterprises are much more a means to achieve value, they are a verb, not a noun. In Canada we tend to define social enterprise as a business operated by a non-profit entity, with a product or service they sell to customers and a defined social, cultural or environmental value.

Social Enterprise measures success with what Jed Emerson stated more than 10 years ago, a ‘blended value bottom line’ ([http://www.blendedvalue.org](http://www.blendedvalue.org)). It is not financial or social, it is financial and social. It is the simultaneous achievement of both economic and social values.
