Our first event of the year, and we’re starting with a BANG! Join us for the [Idea Showcase](/inspire/ideashowcase2012) on October 17th.

The c3 Idea Showcase will feature inspiring and passionate entrepreneurs presenting and sharing their revolutionary ideas. Open to all students, entrepreneurs, and the passerby, the showcase is a platform to share your vision with fellow students and advisors. Everyone is encouraged to *Connect* with those who shared ideas they found inspiring, then *Collaborate* and *Create* something out of the vision. Above all, attendees will have the opportunity to go one-on-one with presenters and advisors – getting feedback on your best ideas and developing valuable connections.

A night of high-powered networking and exciting student entrepreneurs. Find out more at our [event page](/inspire/ideashowcase2012).
