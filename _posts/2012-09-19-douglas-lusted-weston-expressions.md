We recently had the opportunity to sit down with Douglas (Doug) Lusted, founder of Weston Expressions. He shared with us the story of how he developed his promising business and some of the challenges he faced along the way.

**Ryan:** So Doug, why don’t you start by giving us a little background on yourself?
**Doug:** I don’t know what to say – I’m a pretty normal guy. I’m 19 years old. I’m a 2B Environment and Business student at UW. I try to get on the ice whenever I can. I am also a music producer on the side and own a small website development business to help entrepreneurs with web solutions. Other than that, all my time goes towards Weston Expressions.
**Ryan:** How about you give us a background of your company Weston Expressions – what do you do, what is the unique value you provide?

**Doug:** Weston Expressions offers an innovative new way for advertisers to reach their market through the installation of flexible screens on escalator handrails. We’re unique in that not only are we the only company who is doing this but we will also be able help advertisers reach their specific market by changing the ads shown on the screen based on time and location. We offer a new solution to advertisers whose clients have specific needs for generating awareness and offer a new revenue stream to building owners.

**Ryan:** When you say it, it seems so simple. As soon as you hear it you can’t help but thinking “That makes so much sense” and then “Why has no one thought of this before?”. So how did this idea come to you?

**Doug:** Well like I said, I am music producer on the side. Last year I was working with a couple of artists and we would put their posters of their upcoming mixtapes and CDs in subway stations and tracked twitter followers to see if the advertisements worked. As a joke one day, I taped a small piece of a poster to an escalator handrail and later we saw that our twitter hits went through the roof!

**Ryan:** That’s incredible. That’s how you got the idea, at what point did you know it had so much potential?

**Doug:** Well like any entrepreneur, one of the hardest parts of start of any new venture is that first six months of wondering “Am I wasting my time?”, especially when bigger costs come around. This stopped for me when I hired some marketing companies to research our product and see if it could work. When I got the results back, it was pretty clear there was money to be made off this idea.

**Ryan:** Your product sounds very technically complicated. How did you overcome a lack of formal technical education to develop this product?

**Doug:** One of the key things my father told me was that “People love helping people”. Not all of them, but people generally like helping people. Like you said, I’m not a techy guy – I’m an environment business students. I handle the business side of things but I needed someone to handle the engineering side of things. I think just networking and posting ads, using Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIN, Kijiji is the best way to find what you need. I was looking for an electrical engineer for 2 months before I found someone I could trust. You have to network to find someone who can get things done. And we’re in Waterloo, that’s not hard to find – we’re one of the best in the world for technology.

**Ryan:** Were there any resources or programs you found particularly useful?

**Doug:** Well I started my business through the Waterloo Enterprise Co-op so that’s a program I’m still involved with that was really instrumental in my success and still is. I owe almost everything to them.

There are tons of resources and groups out there dedicated to supporting new ventures. I went to tons of workshops between classes at UW. Velocity was also a really big help. Also, in Waterloo there are so many start-ups that you can just email founders or at least people in sales (because they always respond) and hook up with some really knowledgeable people. The main thing is that you need to network and get into the groups and spaces where entrepreneurs are meeting and collaborating.

**Ryan:** In your networking did you hook up with any mentors? What role have mentors played in Weston Expressions?

**Doug:** Mentors played a huge role in helping me start this venture. As part of the Waterloo Enterprise Co-op you are assigned a mentor. On top of my assigned mentor, my professor Wayne Chan – who I met through one of the workshops I talked about earlier – was extremely helpful to me. Also, Brett and Mike of Velocity even to this day sit down with me and help me out. Like I said, people like helping people, and there are so many people out there willing to mentor if you make the effort to network.

The thing you have to watch out for is that mentors aren’t just there to affirm what you said – you got to actually be willing to listen to it and adapt how you’re growing your business.

**Ryan:** You kind of alluded to the fact that many entrepreneurs have a ‘lone wolf’ mentality but that you have to willing to adapt if you want to benefit from mentors. What other ways have you allowed yourself to collaborate?

**Doug:** Well first off there are two types of people you collaborate with: your customers and your mentors. With your customers you got to be careful because even though they best know how you can better satisfy them but you don’t want to change your business too much for them because you know they don’t have your best interests at heart. Mentors on the other hand, give advice in the best intentions but you got to gauge for yourself how valid that advice is.

For example, one of my mentors has worked in the engineering field for a long time so I know any engineering facts he advised me about I could rely on completely. If I had business questions then I have a mentor who is very successful in starting his own business. At the end of the day you don’t have to take every piece of advice because it is your business, but on the other hand you want to adapt your business in the way that is going to make it most successful. In my opinion, surrounding yourself with expert mentors who you can trust is the best way to get advice you need to adapt your business. If you have these mentors then you definitely should collaborate with them as much as you can.

**Ryan:** Was there ever a time when one of your mentors was advising you in a completely different direction than what you wanted?

**Doug:** There’s never been a direct conflict but the biggest question mark in my business is our business model – how we make money. And there are a bunch of different opinions on how we should do it. I guess my strategy has been to keep as many option open as possible. Each model has its merits and for me the best strategy would be to allow myself to implement different ones as they fit. I think the technology we’ve developed is versatile enough that as we expand into new markets will have to make money in different ways and then these different opinions will be able to be implemented.

**Ryan:** If you could back a year to before you started Weston Expressions and you could give yourself one piece of advice, what would it be?

**Doug:** Hmm, that’s a tough question. I guess it would be to just go for it. Think less and just do it. Figure out who you need to know, what you need to do and just get off the couch. At the end of the day you’re not going to achieve anything if you don’t go for it.

One of the smartest things I have ever done was to pitch my idea at the GTAN [Golden Triangle Angel Network] $50,000 business competition. All the other entrants had developed products and businesses that were already started. I decided to just go for it and I ended up making it to finals. I didn’t win but through that I met potential clients, investors, manufacturers – all sorts of contacts.  Even though I just had a concept, I just went for it and had all these great results from it.
