“Not happy, not satisfied, not productive, not loyal, not inspired…” If this describes your typical day at work then maybe it’s time to hop out. [Alan Hall](http://blogs.forbes.com/alanhall/)‘s article shows you the art of saying goodbye and succeed as an entrepreneur! Below is an excerpt from his article:

<blockquote>
	<p>If you’re a company leader who doesn’t focus on keeping employees engaged, make note; your days are numbered. I suggest you change now, with sincere intent to take care of your people, or suffer the disastrous consequences of your own unemployment.</p>
	<p>I have more to say on this topic to company management. Who do you think does all the work in your business? Who do you think makes your products, sells them, provides support, collects receipts and pays workers? It’s not you, my friend. Have you forgotten that you hired these people as a resource to help you build a highly profitable business? Have you forgotten they are a precious asset to be valued and protected? How long do you think you can mistreat quality workers until they bolt? In a word, it’s not very long. Do you get the picture? Am I making sense? In sum, your financial success, your promotions, your glory, all depend on how well you treat those subordinates who have placed their trust and confidence in you.</p>
	<p>Now a word to Les Miserables. If you are going to quit, for heaven’s sake, don’t go to work for another pathetic firm. Do something wild: Kiss your boss goodbye and launch your own business. If you have had enough, become your own king. The money you have made for others now shifts to yourself. Take that idea that’s been in your mind for months and turn it into a profitable company. If you are an engineer, a programmer, a salesman, a teacher, an accountant, a whatever, start today planning your escape from corporate prison.</p>
