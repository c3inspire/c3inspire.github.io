An idea is a thought or suggestion as to a possible course of action. If only generating these ideas are as simple as a dictionary definition. [Alan Hall](http://blogs.forbes.com/alanhall/) shares the secret to creating a “world-class idea in six easy steps”. Below is an excerpt from his article:

<blockquote>
	<p>I often meet business founders whose minds are overflowing with brilliant ideas for new products. They seem to develop terrific new concepts every single day of their lives. They are watchful, always inquiring, perceptive and continually seeking (and often finding) the next big thing. Their never-ending challenge is to pick a winner—(only one!)–out of scores of possibilities, and run with it.</p>
	<p>On the other hand, I listen to intelligent and aspiring entrepreneurs who can’t concoct a single viable idea. These great souls are bright and earnest, but for some reason, imaginative ideas escape.</p>
	<p>Within my circle of friends I see both types of individuals. One is the quintessential entrepreneur who has developed several companies and has recently launched a new firm.</p>
	<p>The other struggles to envision the next great product everyone in America would want. From time to time, he asks me if there is a method to generating a great idea.</p>
