In grade school, Nicole’s favorite class was Art and her goal was to be an artist when she was older. Her love for marketing began in University when she discovered that she could combine her love for design and keen skill for business, during a marketing course. Nicole’s aptitude to work with people is stemmed from her Human Resources Specialization. Nicole was able to bring these passions to life as the Chief Operating Officer of uIntuition. Her ability to keep things moving, organized and “operating” stems from her organization and inner passion for uIntuition’s mission, vision and values. She seeks to help all students professionally develop themselves through the opportunities uIntiuition can offer and loves seeing people’s dedication and passions drive them forward.

uIntuition is a platform that represents and connects talented post-secondary students with various opportunities. Areas of service include two main sectors: the Academic and the Creative. The Academic sector involves students tutoring other students in classes with potential topics ranging from practical skills (e.g., Adobe Photoshop) to traditional academic subjects (e.g., English). The Creative sector focuses on projects that include design, photography, music, and DJing. We dedicate our efforts toward showcasing the talents and passions of students. Involvement with uIntuition is way for students to build their resumes and portfolios, expand their networks and earn money simultaneously; all while loving the work they do! For customers, uIntuition offers personable solutions that are flexible to customization, budgets and even tight deadlines.

### What was your objective when you decided to start a business?
My objective to start a business was to work when and how I wanted to, versus working for someone. I have also always felt that I have an aptitude for helping others and therefore decided to major in social and developmental studies. I have always wanted to be in a profession that allows me to help and interact with people and I thrive in human services. Naturally, I fed my hunger for human services by incorporating a Human Resources (HR) Management specialization into my program.

When evaluating today’s working world and HR trends and having worked since I was legally allowed to, I quickly realized that a traditional career wasn’t going to cut it. Therefore, I decided that I would begin pushing the boundaries of the conventional working world by joining a start-up. Most people won’t get to find out in their twenties that a desk job doesn’t particularly tickle their fancy. I however, was fortunate to realize this at the ripe and forward thinking age of twenty-on.

### What was the process of turning your idea into a business? What did you do first?
The process to turn my idea into a business was through problem solving. I identified a common problem that was reoccurring in youth talent and volunteering recruitment, which led me to an idea for a human services business. In all reality, I owe the idea to my friends. They have always come to me for assistance with connections or a volunteer opportunity, and I have always seemed to love looking for these opportunities for them. Naturally, I love seeing people grow and form their passions – whether it is caring for animals or working with the elderly.

My idea was a platform that would connect students to volunteer opportunities. The platform would create a hub of career development opportunities. I realized that most of my peers were struggling to realize their career passion as they lack the necessary experience. Moreover, they either were unable to successfully differentiate themselves in a competitive situation or were simply not sure where to start when looking for a volunteer position.  I knew this was a problem. I wanted to fix it with my passion for helping others and keen understanding of the career world.

When I attended the c3 conference in October 2012, I had no idea that a life changing opportunity was awaiting me. The team that I was placed in for the day, and I, had pitched the volunteer platform idea and won. Before the conference was over, I met Melissa Morgan. My memory of her during that initial meeting was of a bright, eager, and passionate young woman. We connected on the common ground of:

1. We loved helping others;
2. We realize that there is a lost career potential of so many students;
3. We are creatively driven, forward thinking, and enthusiastic individuals.

Melissa and I connected through email and Facebook. The rest is history.

### What is the problem your business desire to solve?
uIntuition desires to solve two problems for two different customers we cater to. First, we seek opportunities for students who want to professionally develop themselves but just don’t have the time or resources to do so successfully. Second, we seek to connect help seekers to amazing talents for many branding, marketing, performance, and tutoring projects. The combination of solving the above two problems results in a platform that offers creative, meaningful and exciting work or help for the stakeholders involved.

### Were people in your team all strangers before start-up? If you start a business with your friend, what kind of things you need to look out for?
Prior to the fruition of the uIntuition, the two co-founders – Michal Ulman and Melissa Morgan – were friends for many years. I joined the executive team as the Chief Operating Officer as a result of meeting Melissa at the c3 conference in 2012. Three other friends joined the team later on. One lesson that we have all learnt is that blurring the line between business and friendship could be a risky proposition that causes many issues and dilemmas. Therefore, it is important for individuals to have a business persona. It helps to gets things done. Individuals on the team can maintain their own personalities and can even form a friendship along the way, but ideally, they should not blur the lines as much as possible.

### What kind of backgrounds/experiences to you think is crucial to a start-up team?
Backgrounds that are cruicial to  a start up team are a mix of business knowledge, HR, public relations (PR), marketing, financial, and of course the technical know-how if you are working with technology in any way – even if it’s email. However, besides all of these important backgrounds, the most important attribute is networking. The team should always be seeking business connections, as it is a crucial path to growth and something that a start-up can consistently put into action. You never know whom you will meet and who will like your idea. The person you are talking to could be an investor, could own a business that you could collaborate with, could be a supplier… the list is endless and that person could help advance your business to surprising levels.

### How did you obtain the initial funding? How much was it? Where did it go?
The initial funding uIntuition gained was a mix of hard work and luck on our side. As a team, we used our own money to cover the cost of website hosting. Everything else, such as marketing, design, and financials were all done in house by our own team. The initial funding of the business was not obtained until months after the business had started, and it came from two different sources. We first obtained funding through Velocity, and it was a prize for “the People’s Choice Award”. Then, our co-founder Michal Ulman was named one of the winners in a competition through the Enterprise Co-op undergraduate program, which is part of the University of Waterloo’s Conrad Business, Entrepreneurship and Technology Centre.

### What was the early advertising strategy you adopted to promote your product/service?
The early advertising strategy adopted to promote uIntuition included posting on a variety of websites. Being a part of a start-up usually means that resources are limited at the beginning. uIntuition, being the creative bunch that we are, decided upon a lean model of advertising and marketing. We spread the word through our (personal) Facebook and Twitter accounts, and we utilized other online resources such as Pinterest and LinkedIn. We then created a Facebook page for uIntuition and invited our friends, families, and classmates. We contacted local news stations and forged connections with news anchors that expressed interested in supporting our cause. uIntuition also had support from the University of Waterloo staff and faculty, which resulted in a funded office space at the Accelerator Centre. Being located at the Accelerator Centre allowed us to make many meaningful connections. This helped our word of mouth advertising, which is invaluable in any industry; especially the one uIntuition is in.

### If you could start over, what could you have done better?
If the opportunity to restart happened to present itself, I believe I would have put more of my ideas into actual action earlier on in the process. At times, as an entrepreneur, one will find himself or herself thinking big and “pushing the boundaries”, if you will, without the actual action piece. However, there comes a time when you have to be accountable to what you have built from the ground up – your start-up. At the end of the day, you only get back what you put in, and in this case, it isn’t up to anyone but yourself and the team to produce a result. A start-up is one of the only few environments that you get to really see the *full* impact of your efforts.

A famous quote from Theodore Roosevelt truly describes the current changes that are making uIntuition better: “Nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort, pain, difficulty…” Theodore Roosevelt’s words should ring true to anyone who is working on his or her business. However, alongside that thought, I believe that there can be a little mix of fun too.
