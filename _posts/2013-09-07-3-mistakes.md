Mistake #1- Always look at the present and ignore the big picture

They overlook the importance of short-term growth rather than the growth accumulation over long period. Rome is not built in one day, so does the start-ups. The tip here is that, success takes time, steady growth is better than rush for quick results.

Mistake #2- Fundraising is the most important milestone

Many start-ups use the result of fundraising as the major determinant of the companies’ success. That is a wrong conception. Execution is most important. Many tech start-ups require little start-up cost. Making a great prototype and conducting market research are far more important than getting cash from VCs. If you have successfully done both mentioned about, you don’t need to bother to look for money, money will find you.

Mistake #3- Too many ideas and too little action

Execution is everything. No matter how great the idea is, it is nothing without execution. People always think too much and do so little. That is why most start-ups can’t survive or even be created.
