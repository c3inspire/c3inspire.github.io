Unlike their larger counterparts, small companies are embracing a new technology wave hitting the enterprise space – Bring your own Apps! [Matt McIlwain](http://www.forbes.com/lists/midas/2011/profile/matt-mcilwain.html) investigates this growing trend and what it means for businesses. Below is an excerpt from his article:

<blockquote>
	<p>Everyone in IT knows the pitfalls of the “bring-your-own-device” craze – the practice of tech-savvy employees using their own smartphones and tablets for work. Now, BYOD has ushered in the era of “bring your own application” or BYOA. That’s the new catchphrase for small groups of employees bringing business-focused apps into the enterprise, often via powerful smartphones and tablet computers, to share documents and collaborate on work with colleagues inside and outside their company.</p>
	<p>Security concerns aside, there’s good news here. Namely, that BYOA is creating a new way into the enterprise for a host of innovative companies with lightweight, mobile apps and great growth potential. Think <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>, for cloud file-sharing; <a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a>, for online note-taking; <a href="http://www.goodreader.com/">GoodReader</a>, for document viewing and annotating; and <a href="http://www.smartsheet.com/">Smartsheet</a>, for  online project management. Often, these apps gain a toehold into enterprises when individual employees or small teams start using them, just as small groups inside companies first gave traction to products like <a href="http://http//finapps.forbes.com/finapps/jsp/finance/compinfo/CIAtAGlance.jsp?tkr=crm">Salesforce.com</a> and <a href="http://finapps.forbes.com/finapps/jsp/finance/compinfo/CIAtAGlance.jsp?tkr=sfsf">SuccessFactors</a> years ago. If these new, cloud-based apps improve productivity and boost product quality, workers will insist they are deployed more broadly.</p>
	<p>The trick for these startups will be to make themselves as palatable to IT departments as they are alluring to individual consumers and small teams. It’s no easy balance. But the winners in BYOA will do it if they want to redefine commercial software.</p>
