In this era of information explosion, journalists and media companies always find it difficult to pinpoint reliable and knowledgeable sources for information. Mediaspotme is a Waterloo-based start-up that is built to solve this problem. We got a chance to sit down with **Ebrahim Ashrafizadeh** to talk about Media Spot Me and his journey to become an entrepreneur.

Ebrahim graduated from the University of Waterloo in 2010, where he had studied Mechatronic Engineering. He mostly worked with things related to automation, which is more closely tied to his field. But he always had a passion for web design. As his co-op terms evolved, Ebrahim started working in smaller and smaller companies, and with smaller teams and more focused tasks. Finally, he decided that he really want to start his own company. So he took a leap of faith and launched www.mediaspotme.com, a website that designed to help journalists find and reach credible experts for stories.

So why start his own business?  Well it’s all in the ability to build something that other people would get value out of. When he met his co-founder, a journalist for many years, Ashrafizadeh was intrigued.  His friend told him about a daily problem that he faced as a journalist, and it sounded like a problem he could solve. This idea of building easy tools to solve existing problems has always been his passion.

It is very interesting when he took the first step to build his business. He told me that what ends up happening often in a start-up is that you get so paranoid about your idea. Sometimes you even paralyze to do anything about them. One positive they had was that his co-founder was the one who experienced the need for this idea. And whenever he was just thinking about business idea even before he and his co-founder, he was always looking it like this is another messaging gap, or this is just another app for this, app for that. How are they going to make money and how are they going to survive? He analyzed all these different things. He said, as you go down to this path, you realize the idea is not that important. It is actually the execution. For them what they did was to take a contract project with the co-founder. He suggested they should come out with a prototype. In the meantime, they accessed each other’s skill and the validity of the idea. So they built the prototype in a course of several months. That is due to the fact that they were both committed to other things in the startup.  They sent each other emails back and forth. Later they heard positive feedbacks from an industry professional. That led them to take this seriously and eventually quitting the job and doing this full time.

Money is lifeblood of every start-up. Media Spot Me obtained an initial $30,000 funding from a venture capital program that really helped them get started through promotions, like attending conferences and gaining exposure through others. They took full advantage of Velocity (put velocity hyperlink), which also saved them a huge amount of money. Most of the money was spent on employing people with skills that they didn’t have.

One area he wished he had done better: Advertising. Ensuring that he followed up with people he had connected with initially is very powerful. The referral traffic is very important to something like they do. Journalists don’t have time to scour the Internet and they often turn to other fellow journalists for tips and solutions, so word of mouth was very important for Mediapostme.com. The other thing that worked really well was twitter, which drew a lot of traffic .Every morning they get some experts on the breaking news topics and tweet about them. Then they slowly build up a group of dedicated followers on twitter.

The one thing he would change if he started over? Contrary to what most people say about data, He says he would have analyzed less. He has a technical background that makes him focus on the numbers. Because of the amount of data they could get, they planned things eight months ahead and focus too much on those small details. It caused a delay in their business when they could have focused on moving ahead. So don’t stop, don’t worry about the numbers, don’t worry about the results, just keep going and keep your business moving forward!
