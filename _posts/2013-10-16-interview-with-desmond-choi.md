SparkGig is a recent Waterloo start-up that creates an online marketplace for local music performers to connect with event opportunities. Their objective is to make live  performances affordable for everyone so that everyone can be able to enjoy music and entertainment everywhere anytime. Today, we are honored to have a Q&A with the co-founder Desmond Choi of this amazing start-up and tell us more stories behind the scene.

### What was your objective when you decided to start a business?
The drive for me to start a business is always about solving challenges that keeping me awake at night. I believe entrepreneurs are problem solvers, we see challenges as opportunities, entrepreneurs create service/ product that changes how we view the world and improve our society.

### What was the process of turning your idea into a business? What did you do first?
Not all ideas can be turn into a business, the best way to test is your business idea worth investing your time and afford is to talk to your customers. See how much money are your customers going to pay for your product or service. Do not assume you have the best idea in the world, but talk to as much people as possible, get feedback from your potential customers. If your idea is great they will pay you upfront to develop it.

### What is the problem your business desire to solve?
When I was in high school I was part of a breakdance crew and school orchestra. I love performing at events but looking for gigs was hard for us. I am starting Sparkgig, an online platform to bridge the community of performers with event planners. I believe everyone should be able to enjoy music and entertainment everywhere anytime. Currently there is a huge connection barrier between the performers and the performance opportunity. Sparkgig we envision the way people interact with live entertainment should be simple easy and affordable everywhere around the world.

### Were people in your team all strangers before start-up? If you start a business with your friend, what kind of things you need to look out for?
We are all friends before we started Sparkgig, we got united by the vision we have for the company. I believe skills and experience can be develop easily but Trust and Relationship are far more important than anything else. One thing to look out for when forming a team is never assumes you know what other people are thinking. Always have an open environment, keep updating with your co-founders and teammate, and understand their concerns and feelings.  Big conflict happens because of many small conflicts add up.

### What kind of backgrounds/experiences to you think is crucial to a start-up team?
Regardless of what type of business or industry you are entering you should always be an expert of your field. If your business is Web base or tech focus than you should have a strong Computer Science Co-founder, if your business is focus on the financial market than you should have someone on your team know finance.

### How did you obtain the initial funding? How much was it? Where did it go?
Always start with bootstrapping. Don’t quit school or your full time job even though you might think your idea is the best. Work on your idea part time and try to build a basic prototype to prove your concept then get some customer feedback. Depending on the product or service you are doing the cost and development time will be totally different. Nevertheless, evaluate how much risk you can handle and think if this fail what would happen to me.

### What was the early advertising strategy you adopted to promote your product/service?
I think nowadays no one trust advertising or promotion anymore. Startup should focus on branding because you don’t have millions of dollar to invest in marketing. Good way to start is talk to people you know, world of mouth is the most effective marketing method. Your friends trust your recommendation more than a TV adv. Later on you can start using social media to promote your business/ service. Depending on your market, B2C or B2B, you will have different marketing strategy, just always remember put yourselves in your client’s situation and think from their perspective. Is not about what you say but how they interpreted it.

### If you could start over, what could you have done better?
If I could start over I wish I could have worked on this business sooner! Working on something you are truly passionate about is exciting and motivating.
