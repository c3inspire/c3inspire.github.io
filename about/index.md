Whether you want to create the next disruptive technology or a program to educate children in developing countries you need one thing: a strong team. If you want to accomplish something great you **need** a group of people that share your vision and complement your abilities. C3 was created to unlock the huge potential of student leaders at different Universities in Ontario by: *Connecting* them with other high-energy, high-achieving students, enabling them to *Collaborate* on an entrepreneurial venture or social change initiative, and providing the resources they need to *Create* something that will make a positive, lasting impact on the world.
