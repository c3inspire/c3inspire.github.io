C3 Next Conference was created for aspiring and high-achieving students with an innovative spirit who want to explore ideas and bring them to life. Motivated individuals come from a variety of disciplines to gain inspiration and build relationships that aid in the development of for-profit ventures or social change initiatives.

To do this, the C3 Next focuses on three elements that craft the distinctive features of the one-day conference:

## Connect
C3 Next connects talented and motivated high school students across Ontario with other students that have a similar passion and interest in innovation to bring positive change to the world.

## Collaborate
Participants will collaborate with workshop advisors and industry professionals on their ideas. Advisor guided workshops are held throughout the day to facilitate discussion and each focuses on a different aspect to help move participant ideas along.

## Create
C3 Next is geared to help talent students discover the innovation within them and provides a structured way to help high school students bring their idea to life!
