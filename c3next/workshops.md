title: Idea Workshops
---
<p class="lead">Idea workshops enable students from various high schools to form diverse teams in which they put their talents together to brainstorm innovative ideas.  The purpose of the workshop is to give students a hands on experience, on how innovation happens by combining different perspectives and talent. Students will discuss various problems that they may want to solve and decide on one idea to work on for the day.</p>
<p class="lead">With this beautiful experiential learning process, students get an opportunity to deliver their ideas to peers and professionals for constructive feedback. In the second idea workshop, students will create a 30 second pitch that effectively explains their idea. The most innovative and progressive ideas may even get an opportunity to present in front of the entire conference!</p>
