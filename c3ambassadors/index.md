title: C3 Ambassadors
---
The C3 Ambassador program is designed to recognize key individuals who demonstrate the values of the C3 Organization and who support C3 Inspire activities. The C3 Ambassadors are the key to reaching exceptional students and helping us to unlock their potential. Ambassador duties include fostering a spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship within their community, sharing their experience and knowledge to help C3 build a strong organization, and actively promoting C3 events to students and classes so that inspired students are able to take advantage of these opportunities.

The benefits of being a C3 Ambassador include numerous opportunities to participate in C3 events as advisors or speakers, special considerations for students during the selection process that are suggested by a C3 Ambassador, a picture and bio being featured on the website, and a certificate of recognition and appreciation as a leader in both innovation and entrepreneurship.

If you or someone you know fits the C3 Ambassador role - whether they would be teachers or industry professionals - please let us know by emailing the partnership manager at hasanain@c3inspire.com.
